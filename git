1. What is Git?
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and is used to help coordinate work among several people on a project while tracking progress over time. In other words, it’s a tool that facilitates source code management in software development.

Git favors both programmers and non-technical users by keeping track of their project files. It enables multiple users to work together and handles large projects efficiently.



2.How is Git different from Subversion (SVN)?
GIT                                                                                                                        SVN

Git is a distributed decentralized version control system                                        SVN is a centralized version control system.

Git stores content in the form of metadata.                                                      SVN stored data in the form of files.

The master contains the latest stable release.                                                   In SVN, the trunk directory has the latest stable release 

The contents of Git are hashed using the SHA-1 hash algorithm.                                   SVN doesn’t support hashed contents. 




3.Git Version Control System
A version control system is a software that tracks changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It also allows you to work together with other programmers.

The version control system is a collection of software tools that help a team to manage changes in a source code. It uses a special kind of database to keep track of every modification to the code.

Developers can compare earlier versions of the code with an older version to fix the mistakes.



4.What Does Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) Mean?
A distributed version control system (DVCS) is a version control system that operates on a distributed hardware principle or, in some other distributed computing systems, like a virtual network.
